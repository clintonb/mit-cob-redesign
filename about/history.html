<p>The MIT Club of Boston (MITCOB) is dedicated to providing ways for MIT Alumni/ae in the Greater Boston area to know, meet, and work with one another in the expansion of their professional, cultural, and social horizons. The Club also serves to link members more closely to MIT through its programs and other activities.</p>

<p>All MIT alumni/ae, spouses of alumni/ae, current students, parents of current students, and MIT faculty and staff are eligible to get involved in the club. We hope that you consider becoming a member and volunteering to help with our events or program groups.</p>

<p>The club was originally established in 1946 as the Boston Luncheon Club. It became the MIT Club of Boston in 1961. We are an independent, not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) organization that is member-funded and volunteer-operated.</p>
