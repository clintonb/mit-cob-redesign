<div class="branding">
    <p>The MIT Club of Boston centers on its mission to facilitate networks among Boston metropolitan area alumni, and
        we
        have developed a new logo, launched in January 2012, to reflect our brand. The logo was developed to express the
        synergies created when individual alumni come together. Its clean, modern design, reflects our values and
        creates a
        crisp new look.</p>

    <p>Our branding was developed by Keith Kitz of <a href="http://onemansstudio.com/">One Man's Studio</a>, who was
        inspired by the shapes
        formed when representing a Fibonacci series with squares. The logo exists in all three of MIT's colors, shown
        below.
        We will develop our brand and image around this logo and shapes.</p>
